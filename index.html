            <p>Like many others, I was captivated by the creative artistry and technical expertise that I encountered on my television screen as a child. When I held a camera for the first time, I grasped the possibility of what my idols in television and filmmaking had been seeing: an empowering opportunity to create another world more awesome than my own. This curiosity quickly propagated into a yearning for personal creativity and a resilient passion for filmmaking that could not be easily satisfied.</p>

            <p>During my first year of college, I landed an internship in Los Angeles that allowed me to explore a variety of departments within film production and learn invaluable information regarding production logistics. After six months of professional work experience, I then obtained an Associates Degree in Film Production. Immediately following, I continued on to complete my Bachelors Degree at Arizona State University with a concentration in Film Business.</p>

            <p>During my schooling, I successfully managed to spearhead many student films as a Producer and Assistant Director as well as work on numerous professional commercial productions in order to advance my ability to work with major clientele. Upon my graduation from ASU, I permanently relocated to Los Angeles to further pursue work opportunities in the film industry.</p>
